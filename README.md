# Provide Insights to the Revenue Team in the Hospitality Domain

## Problem Statement
"AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data."

The Key Performance Indicators(KPIs) in the hospitality industry:

1. **Revenue**: This is the total income generated from the hotel operations, typically from room bookings, but it can also include other services like food and beverages, events, and additional services. It's a key measure of overall business performance.

2. **Occupancy %**: This KPI measures the proportion of available rooms that are occupied during a given time period. It is a crucial metric for understanding hotel demand and capacity utilization.

3. **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room)**: A critical KPI that combines both room revenue and occupancy to give an overall picture of how well a property is performing. It’s calculated as Revenue ÷ Available Room Nights.

4. **ADR (Average Daily Rate)**: This represents the average rate paid for rooms sold and is a key measure of a hotel’s pricing strategy. It’s calculated as Total Room Revenue ÷ Number of Rooms Sold.

5. **Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN)**: This refers to the total number of room nights available for sale on a given day. It's important for assessing how much inventory is available to sell and can help in measuring potential revenue capacity.

6. **Daily Booked Room Nights (DBRN)**: This represents the number of room nights that have been booked for a given day. It's a key indicator of how well a hotel is selling its available inventory.

7. **Daily Utilized Room Nights (DURN)**: This metric shows the number of room nights that have actually been used (stayed in) on a given day, as opposed to simply being booked. It can provide insights into cancellations, no-shows, or other factors affecting room utilization.
